        <h2>About the Song</h2>
        <p>
          “God’s Plan” is meaningful to me because it connects to helping people when they’re going through it.
          I’ve been in tough situations before, and I’ve had moments where someone showing up for me (even in a small way)
          actually mattered a lot. So the message of giving back and not forgetting people feels relatable, not just “famous person talk.”
        </p>
        <p>
          One line that really hits me is the idea of “imagine if I never met the broskies.”
          I’ve got a couple close friends who’ve been with me since kindergarten, so it makes you think about how different life would be
          without those people. It’s kind of a simple line, but it’s real.

        <h2>About the Artist</h2>
        <p>
          Drake is a Canadian rapper and singer who’s known for mixing rap with more melodic songs. A lot of his music is about ambition,
          relationships, and how success changes your life. He’s also one of the biggest artists of the last decade, so most people have heard
          at least one of his songs.
